# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
  With many large corporations over time, there is a changing of the guard from senior staff to younger managment. We were tasked with finding out who is eligible for retirement and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
### Results
  - Total number of employees due to retire
  - total number of retirees by department
  - total numer of employess eligible for mentorship program
  - total number of mentorship eligible employees by department
  - 
  
### Summary
    How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    
    There are not nearly enough eligible employees that meet the current requirements to make a significant impact for the next generation. Perhaps changing the requirements for qualified employees is necessisary.
