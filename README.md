# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
  With many large corporations over time, there is a changing of the guard from senior staff to younger managment. We were tasked with finding out who is eligible for retirement and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
### Results
  Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
  
### Summary
  Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
    How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
